# Cartographic_Design_Portfolio
This repository contains my up-to-date cartographic design works. These designs come from my course projects and hobby projects. Here is the place to archive my artwork.
Best_Sneaker_Shops_California.pdf
This is a one-page brochure to promote some popular sneaker shops in California. This is my first course project in the Introduction to Cartographic Design course. In this project, I want to understand the map projection knowledge and the cartographic generalization process. This map contains the major map that shows California, annotation of the sneaker shops, inset map that shows the location of California in the USA, etc.

Reference_Map_Africa.pdf
This is a reference map for Africa. This is the second project of the Introductory to Cartographic Design course. This map serves as a spatial catalog for readers, so the map needs to be an information-dense, one-stop graphic. I demonstrate my knowledge of typography (both appearance and placement) as well as continue to practice the map generalization process and visual hierarchy knowledge. This map contains capital cities' names of African countries, major cities' names of African countries, dessert names, river names, lakes names, bay names, ocean names, etc.

Covid_Map.pdf
This is a single-hue, sequential choropleth map that shows the percentage of death in COVID-19 in each county of Wisconsin. I normalized this map by using the total death cases divided by the total population of each county. I used geometric classification with 5 classes, because the original distribution is right tailed. This map contains a major map, an inset map, and a bar graph show the specific death cases in each county. 

Yeezy_VS_Off_White_2019.pdf
This is a hobby project. I created a dot density map to show the annual sales of Yeezy 350 V2 and the annual sales of Off-White (The Ten). Each dot represents 20 purchases. The original data comes from StackX in 2019.
